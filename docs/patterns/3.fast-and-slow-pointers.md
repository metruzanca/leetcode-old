# 3. Fast and Slow pointers
The Fast and Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/linked list) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic linked list), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

How do you identify when to use the Fast and Slow pattern?
- The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array
- When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.

When should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above?
- There are some cases where you shouldn’t use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can’t move in a backwards direction. An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you’re trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.

Problems featuring the fast and slow pointers pattern:
- Linked List Cycle (easy)
- Palindrome Linked List (medium)
- Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
